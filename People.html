When it had passed she had gotten so lost she could not find her way home, so she set out to find it, using her knowledge to survive. On the fifth day, the day of her birthday, she happened upon an abnormally large rabbit, hoping to catch it for food, she hunted it, for she was aching with hunger.

He congratulated her on her birthday, and said he would teach her the ways of the druids, for he had sensed the powers of one awakening within her, and that it was the reason he had helped her. Cloud accepted, and for the next year she all but abandoned her life at the college, and spent her time training as a druid.

                Being born in a family line of musicians and instrument makers, it was only natural for Adrie to pursue her love for music. When she was born, her family made her a violin that she would receive on her 100th birthday, when she’s considered a full grown elf. She was brought up learning the violin, the accordion and pan flute.

                Wanting to preform around the world so everyone could hear her music, she started traveling. She has played in dimly lit inns, in back allies, in congregations, even a short stint as a drummer aboard a slave galley.  Even though she never garnered any fame, she yet somehow managed to make a living nonetheless.

                Adrie used to never really change into her summer and winter aspect, as she’s always been a happy gal, but with the recent war and famine, she’s been liable to transforming between all four seasons.
                One fateful night, as she was sining and playing, venting her frustration of this wretched world, something happened. Her magical gifts was revealed to her, and she’s practiced her magic since. And now, with darker times approaching, she's started carrying weapons, never knowing when she’ll need to use them.
